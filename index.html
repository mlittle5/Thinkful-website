  <h2> About me</h2>
  <p> I have been playing the cello since I was 6 years old and have loved every second of it. </p>
  <p> It is always good to expand your horizions and learn new skills. Recently, I have been learning web development at Thinkful and have been really enjoying the program and the collaboration between my classmates and mentor online. </p>
  <p> Learning a new skill is always difficult however I feel up to the task, and ready to learn more!</p>
